# autonomous-data-analyst
Autonomous Data Analyst is a lightweight command-line tool designed to automatically handle the key steps of data analysis and machine learning. It can load datasets, identify missing values, separate numerical and categorical features, compute correlations, generate exploratory charts, and train baseline models for both classification and regression tasks. The tool also summarizes results into clean reports with metrics, feature importance, and visualizations, making it easier for users to quickly understand their data without manually coding every step. Its goal is to act like a “first-pass analyst” that provides immediate insights and a strong starting point for deeper exploration.
